# Project: Customer segmentation analysis

We did this project as part of an AI and data developer's training at french [Simplon](https://simplon.co/) school.

With the rise of e-commerce, it has become increasingly essential for companies to understand their customers' behaviour and adapt their offers accordingly. Customer segmentation, which involves dividing customers into groups based on common characteristics, is key to these personalised marketing efforts.


You've been a data scientist at the DataFlow agency in London for a few months now. Your manager has given you an assignment for a major client, Uk Retail, a British e-commerce site.


Uk Retail wants to improve the impact of its marketing campaigns through customer segmentation. By adapting your communication to the customer, you will improve the performance of your campaigns.
This is the e-mail address of your manager:

_Hello Maurice,_


_I'm entrusting you with the Uk Retail project, the aim of which is to help their marketing teams improve the return rate of their communication campaign. Using clustering methods, we need to propose a segmentation of customers based on their buying behaviour. To do this, you will need to create new variables such as RFM characteristics. Before you start modelling, you should also carry out an exploratory analysis to analyse the company's overall performance and trends._


_You have a dataset containing online transactions carried out between 01/12/2009 and 09/12/2011. You can perform the segmentation over these two years. You will also need to visualise the clusters using a dimension reduction technique such as PCA or T-SNE._


_You will then need to use the specific characteristics of each group to formulate actionable recommendations for the marketing team (I advise you to use radar diagrams). Following your analysis, you will need to present your findings in slide format to the UK retail teams._


_Finally, you need to propose a maintenance contract. To do this, you will put yourself in the following position: you will perform a customer segmentation on all data up to 31/12/2010. You will then use the data from 01/01/2011 to 09/12/2011 as new data. In fact, it's as if you'd done the segmentation work at the end of 2010 and then come back the following year to update the work. You'll need to find a strategy for assigning existing and new customers to groups. You can either restart the segmentation with the new data, or transform the problem into a classification, whichever makes the most sense. To calculate the length of time between two interventions, use the Rand Index (ARI) to calculate the stability of the clusters over time._


_The last idea is to offer a maintenance contract, for example by coming back every 6 months. The more often you come back, the more profitable it will be for the company, but be careful: this intervention must be necessary, you don't want to overcharge the customer unnecessarily._


_To sum up, what I expect you to do is :_
- _Carry out an exploratory analysis of the company's performance (sales per year, per month, per type of customer)._
- _Make a cluster of the first year_
- _Find a strategy for updating the clustering as and when new transactions are made_
- _Propose a fixed-date maintenance contract_
- _Carry out a cluster analysis and propose marketing actions_


_You can involve two other data scientists from the agency in the project._


_Finally, you will be talking to general management and the marketing department. So you'll need to adapt your jargon accordingly!_


_Good luck!_
